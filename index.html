                    <p>"Chicken Tikka Masala is thought to have been created by a Bangladeshi chef in Glasgow in the
                        1960s.
                        It's
                        a
                        spicy, tomato-based dish seasoned with garlic, ginger, fenugreek and garam masala. In this
                        recipe
                        we used fenugreek leaves for their nutty and slightly minty flavor. If you can't find them,
                        substitute
                        dried
                        mint leaves and a pinch of ground fenugreek. Garam masala is a popular Indian spice blend that
                        usually includes black and white pepper, cloves, cinnamon, mace, cardamom, bay, cumin and
                        coriander.
                        It's
                        pretty
                        easy to find in your local grocery store and most national spice companies." - Food Network </p>

                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>For the chicken marinade: Whisk together the yogurt, ginger, salt, chili powder, garam masala,
                        pepper,
                        turmeric and garlic in a large bowl until combined. Toss the chicken in the spiced yogurt
                        marinade
                        until
                        evenly coated. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours and up to 24.
                        (Overnight
                        works best.) </li>
                    <li>For the sauce: Melt the ghee in a large Dutch oven or wide heavy pot over medium heat. Add the
                        onions
                        and
                        serrano, season with 1 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are
                        golden
                        and
                        beginning to caramelize, 8 to 10 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, until
                        very
                        fragrant
                        and the ginger starts to turn golden and sticks to the bottom of the pot, 2 to 3 minutes. Add
                        the
                        fenugreek
                        leaves, garam masala, chili powder and paprika and cook, stirring occasionally, until very
                        fragrant,
                        about 1
                        minute. Add the tomatoes, breaking them up into pieces with a spoon, and bring to a boil. Reduce
                        the
                        heat
                        and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced by half and the
                        tomatoes
                        are
                        very
                        tender, about 30 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Let the hot sauce cool for about 5 minutes or so, then transfer it to a blender filling no more
                        than
                        halfway. (If your blender is small, you may need to work in batches.) Remove the center cap from
                        the
                        lid
                        and place it on the blender. Cover the lid with a kitchen towel to catch splatters, and pulse
                        until
                        smooth. Add 1/4 cup heavy cream and puree until creamy. Pour into a clean pot and bring to a
                        simmer.
                        Season
                        with salt.</li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, position a rack directly under the broiler and preheat to high. Line a rimmed baking
                        sheet
                        with
                        foil and set a wire rack inside. </li>
                    <li>Arrange the chicken in a single layer on the rack. Broil until the chicken starts to brown in
                        spots,
                        3
                        to 6
                        minutes per side (it will not be cooked through). Remove from the broiler. When cool enough to
                        handle,
                        cut
                        the chicken into 1-inch pieces. Add the chicken to the simmering sauce, cover and cook until the
                        chicken
                        is
                        cooked through, 8 to 10 minutes. </li>
                    <li>Top the chicken and sauce with cilantro. Serve with rice and naan.</li>

                        Lemon Butter Chicken is my family's go-to treat for a rich and hearty meal. The lightly seared
                        and seasoned chicken is placed over a bed of rice

                        and spinach, and is an easy-to-make choice for
                        dinner!
